# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for creating this study guide was to begin to get familiar with the basic processes that go into the development of a webpage. I built this page(per the guidance of my bootcamp prework) to use as a reference point and a tool, to study and reflect on my progress as I continue to grow and learn the skills needed to become a successful software engineer. It solves the problem of organizing my boot camp notes in a way thats advantageous to my personal development in this field. 
I learned a lot about the steps and the process of building and deploying a basic webpage. As these steps are repeated I'm confident that I will quickly become more comfortable working within the cl, GitHub, and using different programming languages.
